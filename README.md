# mini-complier
Mini Compiler compiles program written with special syntax defined for programming language

# Description of project Files: 
 1. ERRORS.h     // Error handling Library
 2. main.cpp        // Main Compiler Code
 3. main.exe        // Executable file of Main Compiler
 4. program.txt     //Sample Code in c that is to be compiled
 5. resource.h      // resources library
 6. textfile.txt         // Sample Code in c that is to be compiled

# How to use mini Compiler:
Start main.exe file.
Enter file name that you want to compile i.e(textfile.txt)
If there are no  errors in your program it will generate target code file i.e (target_textfile.asm) in the same  directory where mini compiler  is copied.
Assemble the code with any assembler to  generate machine code. 
Note: for input output statment I have  write assembly  routines  for decimal, hexadecimal, octal, binary. That are included in MASAM folder
